	This was a project I tackled in summer 2017. My friends had gotten me into 40k the 
	year before, and I had a small Imperial Guard force. We had some homemade terrain, 
	but mainly used random objects and some old Heroclix and Imaginext sets we had from 
	when we were kids.
	
	I had found some examples of modular boards online, but they usually broke a 4'x6' 
	board into six 2'x2' sections, and I wanted more flexibility. My main inspiration was
	to have actual defillade and cover in the ground, hence the trenches.

	The basis of the tiles are 2" insulation foam board glued on top of ~2mm hardboard 
	(which was perhaps overkill, but the smooth base is nice on tables and stops the foam
	from being worn down from constant shifting). I also used two 1" sheets	of foam boards
	layered on top of each other to create 1" deep trenches.

	I cut the foam and hardboard into 1'x1' sections using a table saw and miter saw. I
	took all the cutting very slow as I wanted to get as consistent cuts as I could. Since
	the saw blade is a 16th of an inch, each tile is really only 11 15/16th inces on each
	side rather than a foot.

	Next came the setup for the trench tiles. Each was 3" wide, large enough for a squad 
	of infantry and not much else. Each trench tile connects at the center so that it 
	tiles nicely.

	The gluing process was by far the most time consuming. I only had enough clamps to do
	two boards at once and each board took 40 minutes to dry. It was the bottleneck for
	the project.

	I went through way more glue than I anticipated. I ended up making like 5 or 6 trips 
	back to Lowe's for more wood glue. I spurted that stuff on each tile in massive amounts
	then painted it on with some of those cheap foam brushes (most ended up destroyed).

	Immedietly after I got the glue down I would cover the tile with play sand. One bag of
	sand cost me like $1.50 and I used at max a quarter of it. I wish the rest of the 
	supplies had been that cheap...
	
			<img src="../media/modular-terrain/mt-12.jpg" width="600px"></img>
	Left each tile to dry for an hour or two then dumped off the excess sand that didn't
	stick. I also took a stiff brush and and gave each tile a solid brushing to remove any
	loose particles. I didn't want sand falling off and getting all over my house. I also 
	hand picked off some larger bits that I was worried would cause too much scraping.

	Here's the first mocup with my friend's Dark Eldar on the left and my Imperial Guard
	on the right. I really should go back and dry brush everything to give it this same
	depth.

	Here's everything after it was textured, but before paint.

	Painting process also took a while. Mainly because I got busy with other stuff (and 
	it was EXTREMELY hot in the garage). I was able to squeeze all the painting into a 
	quart of normal latex house paint. It also served as a great sealant to prevent bits
	of sand from falling off.

	And that's it! Everything finished and with a game being played on it. I still need 
	to find time to revisit this and add some more tiles (enough for two 4'x6' boards)
	and dry brush the entire surface to make it look better.

	(The extra scatter terrain also helps to populate boards that don't use the tiles)

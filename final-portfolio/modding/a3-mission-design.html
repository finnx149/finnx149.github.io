	I have a ton of content to add here as I get time. I've been meaning to write down my
	thoughts on good mission design for Arma 3. Plus, i really want to share all the neat
	tricks I did for my spooky Halloween operation "Hunger of the Pine". 
	
	In the meantime, my mission design philosphy aligns very heavily with the principles
	of good game design. I prefer to encourage a specific style of play by providing
	limitations to the players so that they need to come up with or use an alternate
	method to solve a problem. Or even a little used conventional method.
	
	A primary example would be placimg my operation "Holding Things Together" on a map
	that was primarily water with small islands and oil drilling platforms. I wanted
	to encourage the use of small, highly maneuverable, and lightly armored helicopters.
	And people had to use them too, each squad had a dedicated helicopter pilot and
	got to either see or experience VERY tight insertions into hot LZs or just LZs with
	very little space. The result was a really immersive and cool operation that people
	generally liked.
	
	My other Halloween operation, "Hunger of the Pine", has low visibility. It's night
	time and players only have bad nightvision monocles and flashlights. I decided to 
	separate the players into a team of CIA spooks and Russian Spetsnaz goons to artificially
	make the team sizes smaller. I wanted the four man fireteam to feel very much alone,
	but also like they could move stealthily without being detected. I also gave the 
	commanders the instruction to try to not kill each other, to increase tension when the
	opposing teams eventually met. I rarely get that tension in Arma missions, its usually
	"go here, shoot this". 
	
	I still need to update this mission before I play it with my group again.

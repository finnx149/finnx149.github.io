			<p>SEA SALT EATERY is a SEASONAL restaurant 
			located in Minnehaha Park. We open in the 
			spring and close temporarily for business in the 
			late fall.</p>
			</br>
			<h2>PETS:</h2>
			<p>With the exception of trained service animals,
			pets of all kinds are not allowed inside the
			restaurant. Dogs are welcome on the patio but
			must be kept on a leash.</p>
			</br>
			<h2>PARKING:</h2>
			<p>There is a parking lot at the main entrance of the
			park and pay boxes are located at the head of the
			path that leads to Sea Salt. You may also find
			metered parking on the street within the park.
			The smaller side lot adjacent to the round-a-bout
			is for temporary Longfellow house visitors and 
			Sea Salt staff.</p>
